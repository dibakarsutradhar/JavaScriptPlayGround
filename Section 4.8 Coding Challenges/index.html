        <h1>Section 4.8 - Advance JS/ES6 - Coding Challenge</h1>


        <p>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements: <br>
             1. Parks <br>
             2. Streets<br>
        It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build
        year.<br>
        At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following: <br>
            1. Tree density of each park in the town (formula: number of trees/park area) <br>
            2. Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks) <br>
            3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees <br>
            4. Total and average length of the town's streets <br>
            5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. <br>
            If the size is unknown, the default is normal All the report data should be printed to the console. <br><br>
            
        HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrow
        functions, destructuring, etc.</p>
